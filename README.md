## Word-Phrase-Sentence-Similarity

#### In this work, various ways to calculate and evaluate word, phrase and sentence similarity has been explored.


#### The tasks mainly revolve around 4 categories:

* Computing Word Similarity in 2 settings:
  * Constrained - To train a model in a semi-supervised or unsupervised method on a corpus with atmost 1 million tokens.
  * Unconstrained - Any pre-trained word-embedding generation technique can be used to compute the embeddings.
 
* Classification task based on similar-dissimilar phrases.

* Classification task based on similar-dissimilar sentences.

* Use of transformers to do the above classification tasks.


Note: 
1. The details about the datasets, methodologies and tools used can be found documented in the python notebook.
2. The models trained and loaded in the task can be found in the repository.
